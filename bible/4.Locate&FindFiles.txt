locate (to fi nd commands by name), find (to fi nd fi les based on lots of different attributes), and grep

locate command fi nds fi les faster because it searches a database instead of having to search the whole fi lesystem live
locate command cannot fi nd any fi les added to the system since the previous time the database was created
