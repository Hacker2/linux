u can boot with single param to kernel, to fix it u can set password for single, but it will not help cause
u can get root using grub2 with params rw init=/bin/bash  - it will run as root
then you can use passwd root
it's better to set pass to grub, for changing params only by pass
but still we can load from live cd

denied root
u can add to /etc/sudoers line "max ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL"
or
u can add to /etc/sudoers line "max ALL=(ALL) PASSWD:ALL"
then in
/etc/passwd change root:х:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash to root:х:0:0:root:/root:/bin/true
root and su will not work
to return root we need reboot with params rw init=/bin/bash, we can do it only if know grup pass
also we can denied root only for kde & gnome, description in book
