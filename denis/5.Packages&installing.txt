there is two ways to install app, from packages, or from source code
there is rpm and deb packages
to install from source:
./configure     - wich chell all, ie if u have all needed libraries, and create makefile
make            - compile app according to makefile
make install    - install app to /usr/bin docst to /usr/share/doc and condig files to /etc
repository - store packages
it safe, cause new bugs can be updated with new versions from repository
there is apps to manage packages
rpm, urpmi, dpkg, apt, yum, dnf, gnome-software, pkgtool, zypper,
we use dpkg and apt
dpkg - can't resolve dependencies
apt - can resolve dependencies
dpkg [ключи] действие
sudo dpkg -i /<путь>/package.deb                 - install
sudo dpkg -r <package>                           - remove
apt & apt-get - same, but apt new and smaller, but old distros don't know it, and need to use apt-get
